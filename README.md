# celebrity-problem

This problem is as follows:
```
There are n number of people in a room. One of them is a celebrity.
Everyone knows who is celebrity, but celebrity doesn't know anyone.
We have given a function `knows(a, b)`, which tells us if a knows b or not.
We have to find out the celebrity in O(n) time.
```
